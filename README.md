This repository contains the source code for our App Development project [Module ENGS105P - Applied Software Development] where we were required to create an application for a Smart Fridge. Our client was the UCL Computer Science Department and we got (and fulfilled) the following requirements for success:

- to keep stock of items in the fridge
- allow reordering of these items 
- view possible recipes with the chosen items

[Addition Complexity - Scan barcode to add item]

It is written for Native Android.
